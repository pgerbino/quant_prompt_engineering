# Understand the Basics of Prompt Engineering

## Objective
Gain a foundational understanding of prompt engineering and its relevance to quantitative finance. Learn how to craft effective prompts to maximize the value of large language models (LLMs) in financial workflows.

## What is Prompt Engineering?
Prompt engineering is the process of designing and refining the input (prompt) given to an LLM to achieve a desired output. In quantitative finance, this means asking the right questions or giving the right instructions to extract insights, automate tasks, or generate reports.

## Why is Prompt Engineering Important in Finance?
- LLMs are only as good as the prompts they receive. Poorly worded prompts can lead to irrelevant, incomplete, or even misleading outputs.
- Financial data is complex and context-dependent. Clear prompts help ensure accuracy and compliance.
- Effective prompts can automate repetitive tasks, freeing analysts for higher-value work.

## Types of Prompts
- **Instructional**: Direct the model to perform a specific task.
- **Contextual**: Provide background or context to guide the model.
- **Conversational**: Simulate a dialogue for step-by-step reasoning.

## Examples
### Example 1: Instructional Prompt
> "Summarize the key financial ratios in the following balance sheet."
**Why it works:** Direct, clear, and specifies the data to analyze.

### Example 2: Contextual Prompt
> "Given the recent interest rate hike, explain the potential impact on bond prices."
**Why it works:** Provides context (interest rate hike) and a clear task (explain impact).

### Example 3: Conversational Prompt
> Analyst: "What are the main risks in this portfolio?"
> LLM: "The main risks include market risk, credit risk, and liquidity risk. Would you like a detailed breakdown?"
> Analyst: "Yes, please provide details for each."

## Best Practices
- Be specific: Specify the data, format, and scope.
- Avoid ambiguity: Use precise financial terminology.
- Test and iterate: Try different phrasings and review outputs.
- Use examples: Show the model what kind of answer you expect.

## Common Pitfalls
- Vague prompts ("Analyze this data.") lead to generic answers.
- Overly complex or multi-part prompts can confuse the model.
- Ignoring context (e.g., market conditions) may yield irrelevant results.

## Practice Exercise
Write a prompt to:
- Extract all dividend payments from a transaction list.
- Summarize quarterly earnings in bullet points.
