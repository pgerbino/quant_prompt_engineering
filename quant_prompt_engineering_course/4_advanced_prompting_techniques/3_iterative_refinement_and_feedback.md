# Iterative Refinement and Feedback Loops

## Objective
Apply iterative refinement and feedback to improve prompt outputs in finance. Learn how to use feedback loops to enhance accuracy, compliance, and usefulness.

## What is Iterative Refinement?
- Iterative refinement involves testing, reviewing, and improving prompts based on model outputs.
- Feedback loops use human or automated review to guide further prompt adjustments.

## Why Use Iterative Refinement in Finance?
- Financial tasks often require high accuracy and compliance.
- Iterative refinement helps catch errors, improve clarity, and adapt to new data or regulations.

## Examples
### Example 1: Refining a Summary Prompt
> First prompt: "Summarize this report."
> Feedback: "Focus on risk factors and keep it under 100 words."
> Refined prompt: "Summarize this report in under 100 words, focusing on risk factors."
**Discussion:** Feedback leads to a more targeted and useful output.

### Example 2: Automated Feedback Loop
> Step 1: Generate a compliance checklist from a transaction log.
> Step 2: Use a script to compare the checklist to regulatory requirements.
> Step 3: Refine the prompt to address any gaps or errors.
**Discussion:** Automation speeds up the feedback process and ensures consistency.

### Example 3: Human-in-the-Loop Review
> Analyst reviews LLM-generated risk summaries and provides corrections.
> Prompts are updated to address recurring issues (e.g., missing data, unclear language).
**Discussion:** Human feedback ensures outputs meet business needs.

## Best Practices
- Review outputs regularly and update prompts as needed.
- Use both human and automated feedback for critical tasks.
- Document changes and lessons learned for future reference.

## Practice Exercise
- Refine a prompt for generating a financial summary based on feedback from a compliance officer.
- Set up a simple feedback loop using a script to check LLM outputs against a checklist.
