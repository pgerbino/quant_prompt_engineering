# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

## Objective
Explore how RAG enhances LLMs with external financial data. Learn how to use RAG for up-to-date, accurate, and context-rich outputs in finance.

## What is RAG?
- RAG combines LLMs with external data sources (e.g., databases, APIs, document stores) to provide more accurate and current answers.
- The model retrieves relevant information before generating a response.

## Why Use RAG in Finance?
- Financial data changes rapidly; RAG enables access to the latest filings, news, and market data.
- Reduces hallucinations by grounding outputs in real, verifiable data.
- Supports compliance by referencing authoritative sources.

## Examples
### Example 1: Real-Time Market Analysis
> "Using the latest SEC filings, summarize the company's financial health."
**Discussion:** The model retrieves and cites up-to-date filings.

### Example 2: News-Driven Risk Assessment
> "Retrieve recent news about Company X and assess potential risks to its stock price."
**Discussion:** Combines retrieval of news with LLM analysis.

### Example 3: Automated Compliance Checks
> "Check the latest regulatory updates and flag any new compliance requirements for this portfolio."
**Discussion:** Ensures outputs reflect current regulations.

## Best Practices
- Use RAG for tasks requiring up-to-date or highly specific data.
- Validate retrieved data sources for reliability and compliance.
- Combine RAG with prompt engineering for robust, context-aware outputs.

## Practice Exercise
- Design a RAG workflow to generate a daily compliance report using the latest regulatory updates.
- Compare outputs from a standard LLM and a RAG-enabled LLM for a market analysis task.
