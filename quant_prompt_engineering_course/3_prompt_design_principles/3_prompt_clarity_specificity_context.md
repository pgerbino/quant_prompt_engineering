# Prompt Clarity, Specificity, and Context

## Objective
Practice writing clear, specific, and contextual prompts for finance. Learn how to avoid ambiguity and ensure the model delivers relevant, actionable outputs.

## Why Clarity, Specificity, and Context Matter
- Ambiguous prompts lead to vague or irrelevant answers.
- Specific prompts help the model focus on the right data and format.
- Providing context ensures the model understands the financial scenario or dataset.

## Elements of a Clear Prompt
- **Clarity:** Use precise language and avoid jargon unless necessary.
- **Specificity:** Define the task, data, and output format.
- **Context:** Supply background information, timeframes, or relevant constraints.

## Examples
### Example 1: Clear and Specific
> "Summarize the following earnings report in 3 bullet points."
**Discussion:** The model knows to be concise and use bullet points.

### Example 2: Adding Context
> "Given the Q4 2023 earnings report for Company X, highlight any changes in operating expenses compared to Q3."
**Discussion:** Context (Q4 vs. Q3) guides the model to focus on changes.

### Example 3: Avoiding Ambiguity
> Vague: "Analyze this data."
> Improved: "Identify all transactions over $10,000 in the attached CSV and list them by date."
**Discussion:** The improved prompt is actionable and clear.

### Example 4: Specifying Output Format
> "List the top 3 risks in this portfolio as a numbered list."
**Discussion:** The model is more likely to produce a structured, easy-to-read output.

## Best Practices
- Always specify the desired output format (table, list, summary, etc.).
- Include relevant context, such as time period, data source, or business objective.
- Avoid open-ended or generic instructions.

## Practice Exercise
- Rewrite a vague prompt to make it clear, specific, and contextual.
- Write a prompt to extract all capital expenditures from a quarterly report and present them in a table.
