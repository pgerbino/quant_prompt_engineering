# Automating Prompt Evaluation Pipelines

## Objective
Learn how to automate the evaluation of LLM prompts in financial workflows. Understand tools, techniques, and best practices for scalable, consistent assessment.

## Why Automate Evaluation?
- Manual review is time-consuming and may not scale for large datasets or frequent prompt changes.
- Automated pipelines ensure consistency, speed, and auditability.
- Supports continuous improvement and compliance monitoring.

## Key Components of an Automated Pipeline
- **Test Dataset:** Curated examples with known correct outputs (ground truth).
- **Evaluation Scripts:** Code to compare LLM outputs to ground truth (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall).
- **Reporting:** Automated generation of evaluation reports and dashboards.
- **Alerts:** Notifications for failures or drops in performance.

## Examples
### Example 1: Automated Classification Evaluation
> Prompt: "Classify each transaction as income or expense."
> Pipeline: Script compares model output to labeled data, calculates accuracy and F1 score, and generates a report.

### Example 2: Compliance Monitoring
> Prompt: "Flag all transactions that may violate AML regulations."
> Pipeline: Automated checks for false positives/negatives, logs flagged cases for human review.

### Example 3: Regression Testing
> When prompts or models are updated, the pipeline reruns tests to ensure outputs remain accurate and compliant.

## Best Practices
- Use version control for prompts and evaluation scripts.
- Regularly update test datasets to reflect new regulations or business needs.
- Integrate pipelines with CI/CD for prompt and model deployment.

## Practice Exercise
- Build a simple evaluation script for a prompt that extracts financial ratios from reports.
- Set up a pipeline to alert when prompt performance drops below a threshold.
