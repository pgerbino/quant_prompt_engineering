# Prompt Engineering Tools (OpenAI Playground, LangChain, etc.)

## Objective
Explore tools that assist in prompt engineering for quantitative finance. Learn how to use, compare, and integrate these tools into financial workflows.

## Key Tools
- **OpenAI Playground:** Web interface for testing and refining prompts with OpenAI models. Supports prompt templates, parameter tuning, and output review.
- **LangChain:** Python framework for building LLM-powered applications, including prompt chaining, retrieval, and integration with external data sources.
- **PromptLayer:** Tool for tracking, versioning, and analyzing prompt performance.
- **LlamaIndex (formerly GPT Index):** Framework for connecting LLMs to structured and unstructured data sources.
- **Hugging Face Spaces:** Community platform for sharing and testing prompt engineering demos and apps.

## Why Use These Tools in Finance?
- Accelerate prompt development and testing.
- Enable integration with financial data sources (APIs, databases, documents).
- Support version control, collaboration, and compliance.

## Examples
### Example 1: OpenAI Playground for Report Generation
> Use the Playground to test prompts for generating earnings summaries. Adjust temperature and max tokens to optimize output.

### Example 2: LangChain for Workflow Automation
> Build a pipeline that retrieves financial news, summarizes it, and sends alerts to analysts.

### Example 3: PromptLayer for Auditability
> Track changes to prompts used in compliance checks and analyze performance over time.

## Best Practices
- Use version control for prompts and scripts (e.g., Git, PromptLayer).
- Test prompts with real financial data and edge cases.
- Document prompt changes and results for compliance and reproducibility.

## Practice Exercise
- Use OpenAI Playground to design and test a prompt for extracting key metrics from a 10-K filing.
- Build a simple LangChain workflow to summarize daily market news.
