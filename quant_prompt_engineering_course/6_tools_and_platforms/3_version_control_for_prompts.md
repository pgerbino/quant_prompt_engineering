# Version Control for Prompts

## Objective
Understand the importance of version control for prompt development in finance. Learn how to track, manage, and audit prompt changes for compliance and collaboration.

## Why Use Version Control for Prompts?
- Prompts evolve as business needs, regulations, and data change.
- Version control ensures traceability, reproducibility, and accountability.
- Supports collaboration among analysts, compliance officers, and developers.

## Key Tools and Methods
- **Git:** Track changes to prompt files, scripts, and documentation.
- **PromptLayer:** Specialized tool for tracking prompt versions and performance.
- **Documentation:** Use README files or comments to explain prompt changes and rationale.

## Examples
### Example 1: Tracking Prompt Changes
> Use Git to commit each change to a prompt used for compliance checks. Include commit messages explaining the reason for each change.

### Example 2: Auditing Prompt History

### Example 3: Collaborative Prompt Development
> Use pull requests and code reviews to ensure prompt changes are reviewed by compliance and business teams.

## Best Practices
- Use descriptive commit messages and document the purpose of each prompt change.
