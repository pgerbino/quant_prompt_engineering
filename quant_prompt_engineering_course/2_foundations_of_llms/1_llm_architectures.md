# LLM Architectures (GPT, LLaMA, etc.)

## Objective
Learn about the main architectures behind large language models used in finance. Understand their strengths, limitations, and relevance to financial data and tasks.

## Overview of Transformer Architecture
- Most modern LLMs (e.g., GPT, LLaMA) are based on the transformer architecture, which excels at understanding context and relationships in text.
- Transformers use self-attention mechanisms to process input sequences in parallel, making them efficient and scalable for large datasets.

## Key Architectures
- **GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer):** Autoregressive, excels at text generation and completion. Used in OpenAI's models.
- **LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI):** Open-source, efficient, and designed for research and industry use.
- **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers):** Focuses on understanding context from both directions, often used for classification and extraction tasks.

## Relevance to Finance
- LLMs can process large volumes of financial documents, extract insights, and generate reports.
- Choice of architecture affects performance, speed, and suitability for specific financial tasks (e.g., GPT for report generation, BERT for classification).

## Examples
### Example 1: Comparing Architectures
> "Explain the difference between GPT-3 and LLaMA for financial text analysis."
**Discussion:** GPT-3 is proprietary and excels at generation, while LLaMA is open-source and can be fine-tuned for specific financial datasets.

### Example 2: Use Case Selection
> "Which LLM architecture is best for extracting entities from SEC filings?"
**Discussion:** BERT or similar encoder-based models are often preferred for extraction tasks.

### Example 3: Model Limitations
> "What are the limitations of using GPT-3 for real-time trading signals?"
**Discussion:** GPT-3 may introduce latency and hallucinations; specialized, smaller models may be better for real-time use.

## Best Practices
- Choose the architecture that matches your financial task (generation vs. extraction).
- Consider open-source models for customization and compliance.
- Test models on your own data to evaluate performance.

## Practice Exercise
- Research and summarize the main differences between GPT-4 and LLaMA 2.
- Identify a financial task and recommend an LLM architecture for it.
