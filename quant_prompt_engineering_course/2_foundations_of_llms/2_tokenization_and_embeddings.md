# Tokenization and Embeddings

## Objective
Understand how LLMs process and represent financial text data. Learn how tokenization and embeddings impact the performance and accuracy of LLMs in quantitative finance tasks.

## What is Tokenization?
- Tokenization is the process of breaking text into smaller units (tokens), such as words, subwords, or characters.
- LLMs operate on tokens, not raw text. The choice of tokenizer affects how financial jargon, symbols, and numbers are interpreted.

### Example: Tokenization in Finance
- Text: "AAPL Q2 EPS: $1.52"
- Possible tokens: ["AAPL", "Q2", "EPS", ":", "$", "1.52"]
- Some models may split "EPS" or "1.52" further, depending on the tokenizer.

## What are Embeddings?
- Embeddings are numerical representations of tokens that capture their meaning and context.
- Similar words or phrases have similar embeddings, allowing LLMs to understand relationships (e.g., "profit" and "income").

### Example: Embeddings in Finance
- "Revenue" and "Sales" will have similar embeddings, while "Revenue" and "Liability" will be more distant.
- Embeddings help LLMs generalize across different financial documents and terminology.

## Why Does This Matter in Finance?
- Financial language is full of abbreviations, tickers, and domain-specific terms. Poor tokenization can lead to misinterpretation (e.g., splitting "USD" into "US" and "D").
- Embeddings allow LLMs to recognize synonyms and related concepts, improving extraction and analysis tasks.

## Practical Examples
### Example 1: Custom Tokenization
> "Tokenize the following financial statement and explain the embedding process."
**Discussion:** Useful for understanding how the model interprets complex financial text.

### Example 2: Similarity Search
> "Find all transactions similar to 'interest income' in this dataset."
**Discussion:** Embeddings enable semantic search and clustering of financial data.

### Example 3: Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Terms
> "How does the model handle a new ticker symbol or financial product?"
**Discussion:** Some models use subword tokenization to handle unknown terms, but this can affect accuracy.

## Best Practices
- Use models with tokenizers trained on financial data when possible.
- Review tokenization and embedding outputs for key financial terms.
- Fine-tune embeddings for domain-specific tasks if needed.

## Practice Exercise
- Tokenize a sample earnings report and identify any problematic splits.
- Use embeddings to cluster similar financial terms from a glossary.
